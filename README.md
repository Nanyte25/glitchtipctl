# glitchtipctl

A Commandline Tool for GlitchTip Error Tracking software written in Go.

## Prerequisites

1. You need to have a GlitchTip instance running locally or remotely.
2. You need an API token from GlitchTip to authenticate API requests.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start GlitchTip Locally

To start an instance of GlitchTip running locally, perform the following command after updating the `docker-compose.yaml` file with your email address and password:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- Step 2: Create an Admin Account

If necessary, you can exec into the running webapp container to create a backend admin account.

    Find the container ID by running:

```bash

sudo docker ps  # to get the container ID
```

- Exec into the container using:

```bash

sudo docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash
```

- Once inside the container, create the admin user account by running the following command:

```bash

    ./manage.py createsuperuser  # This will prompt you for the email address and password for the account
```

- Step 3: Set Up the .env File

- Create a .env file in the root of your project directory. This file will store your GlitchTip API token securely.

- Hereâ€™s an example .env file:

```bash

GLITCHTIP_API_TOKEN=your-glitchtip-api-token-here
```

- Replace your-glitchtip-api-token-here with the actual API token from GlitchTip.
- Step 4: Install Dependencies

- Install the necessary Go dependencies, including the godotenv package to load environment variables:

```bash

go get github.com/joho/godotenv

```
- Step 5: Build the CLI Tool

- Once everything is set up, you can build the glitchtipctl binary by running:

```bash

go build -o glitchtipctl
```
- This will create a binary named glitchtipctl in the current directory.
- Step 6: Run the CLI Tool

- After building the tool, you can start using glitchtipctl to interact with your GlitchTip instance.
